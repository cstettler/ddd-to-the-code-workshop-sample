== Constraints

[[dddttc:onion]]
[role=group,includesConstraints="dddttc:*"]

The following constraints are enforced in the code base:


=== C1 - Aggregates must reside in Domain Ring

As aggregates contain business logic and related state, and only the domain ring must contain business logic, aggregates
must reside in the domain ring.

_jQAssistant Constraint Definition_
[[dddttc:AggregateMustResideInDomainRingConstraint]]
.Aggregates must reside in the domain ring.
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="dddttc:AggregateConcept,dddttc:DomainRingConcept"]
----
    MATCH  (a:Aggregate)
WHERE NOT  a:DomainRing
   RETURN  a.fqn AS Aggregate
----


=== C2 - Aggregates must not use Application Services

As application services represent the boundary of the domain towards external contexts, aggregates must not invoke
application services.

_jQAssistant Constraint Definition_
[[dddttc:AggregatesMustNotUseApplicationServicesConstraint]]
.Aggregates must not use application services.
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="dddttc:AggregateConcept,dddttc:ApplicationServiceConcept"]
----
    MATCH  (a:Aggregate)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(s:ApplicationService)
   RETURN  a.fqn AS Aggregate, s.fqn AS ApplicationService
----
